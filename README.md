## Getting And Cleaning Data Project

## Objectives of the  Project
The objectives of the  project includes :
1. A tidy data set 
2. A link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis 
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md

_The script added will perform the following operations:_
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
